To keep my printer ecosystem the same, so I decided to convert my Bear to SW as I did not have integrated lead screws on it anyway.

I'll add soon conversion manual for Bear MK3S frame to SW w/o enclosure soon.
It is not designed for enclosure but can be added with minimum modification.
Design is almost done, just need to add skirts and electronics panel and one below bed.
You need:
- minimum 2 or optimal 4 additional 2020 extrusions.
- 4x 300mm MGN12H
- Keybak Super 48
- Bearings and 3m GT2 belt.
- 2x D2F switches
- 1x NEMA 17 steppers (I had steppers w/ couplers anyway)
- M5 screws of different sizes
